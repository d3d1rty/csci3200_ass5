#Assignment 5 - CSCI 3200 (APSU)
##About
This project is an assignment for CSCI 3200 (XML Processing) course at APSU. Being this is an educational project for a grade, collaboration isn't exactly the goal here. But if you feel that you can benefit from perusing my code, go for it! 

For reference, I have included the original assignment instructions. 

##What it Does
The purpose of the project is to create a DTD for a fictional news feed site. The DTD specifies what elements and attributes make up the XML document and how exactly they are supposed to appear in the document.

##Compiling
No compiling necessary; just make sure you have the DTD in the same directory of the project and include this doctype declaration in your XML document:

`<!DOCTYPE ret SYSTEM "ret.dtd">`

##Dependencies

Nothing to see here, folks.

##Academic Honesty
Please, just keep in mind that academic dishonesty is probably (definitely) not tolerated by your educational institution, so come up with your own solutions. Besides, I sincerely doubt that your assignment has the same requirements as mine, so you will probably look like an idiot if you try to turn this in.

##Credits
This one was all me, homie.

##Questions/Comments/Concerns
If you have any questions regarding this project, send me a message and I'd be more than happy to explain my code.
